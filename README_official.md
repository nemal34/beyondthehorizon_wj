# Horizon - Official Modlist
The official modlist for the Horizon overhaul mod.

---

# Main features
- [Horizon](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/17374), what Fallout 4 should have been: Overhauled gameplay focused on Survival Mode, challenging but rewarding balance, combat changes, healing changes, crafting changes, item sorting, a workshop production system, and the list goes on..
- Stable and (mostly) bugfree experience thanks to [Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4598), [Buffout 4 NG](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/64880) and [High FPS Physics Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/44798)
- Tweaked vanilla visuals using [Architect Weather and Lighting Addon and Texture Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/17374)
- Compatible with Steam and GOG versions of the game, thanks to the magic of delta patching, [Root Builder](https://kezyma.github.io/?p=rootbuilder) and [BASS](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/81859). Make sure to read the [After Installation](#after-installation) section.

# Requirement
- A clean **English** install of Fallout 4 and all its DLCs (except for the HD DLC) from either **Steam** or **GOG**

---

# After Installation
- Select the **profile** corresponding to your game version (Steam or GOG).
- Launch **BethINI** from MO2 and follow the [Game Settings section from The Midnight Ride](https://themidnightride.moddinglinked.com/mo2.html#GameSettings) to set your game settings (Start at Step #8).
- If you are using an **ultrawide** monitor, you will need to enable the **Ultra Wide Interface (21x9)** mod in the left pane of MO2. Make sure it is loaded **below** Horizon.
- Launch **F4SE** from MO2:
    - If you're using the **Steam** version of FO4, a command prompt will appear on the first launch and run the downgrader.\
    The game will now be downgraded but your game files will be intact thanks to Root Builder.
    - If you're using the **GOG** version, the downgrade will be skipped and the game will launch.
- That's it. Enjoy Horizon!
